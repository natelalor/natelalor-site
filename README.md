### The 'Grand Central Station' for my Web Projects
If my web projects were all apartments, [natelalor.com](https://www.natelalor.com/) would be the apartment _building_. This is my main website, which acts as a connection point for all of my web projects as well as some other resources and information I add from time to time. My goal with this website is to provide a one-stop-shop for people who want to see what I am working on.
