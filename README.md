# Summary
This is a repo for my main website, which works as a "hub" of bringing all my web projects under one roof. My goal with this website is to provide a one-stop-shop for people who want to learn more about my web development skillset, and how I will incorporate a personal touch into my web design to show more of who I am. 

Come check it out!
