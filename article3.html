        <p class="match_img_flex">
            From August 2022 to June 2023, I worked at a phone repair business, Wizard Tech. When I wasn't in class at my university, you could find me down at the repair shop in Burlington, VT. While the business is primarily a place that fixes phones, they also computers, tablets, hand-held devices, speakers, and much more. Throughout my time at Wizard Tech, I have had exposure to a variety of devices, tools, software, hardware, and a plethora of problems and solutions related to all of them. My boss helped teach me the ins-and-outs of phone repair, and computer repair, with a concentration on mostly Apple hardware. iPhones and Macbooks have become my specialty.

        Devices I had never seen before would come into the shop all the time, which gave me great exposure to learn more about hardware structure and interior layout integration. Hardware was a niche subject in the realm of computer science that I hadn't been fully introduced to via my university studies, so this job was a great opportunity to gain knowledge in that realm. My boss and the owner of the company, Dylan, was a terrific teacher who was enthusastic about sharing new and exciting information with me. He was a tinkerer at heart, and through him I learned a lot about curiosity, persistence, and loving your craft.

        I also help the business by running their eBay operations. Parting out old PCs and broken phones are my primary responsibilities here, where I dissemble the device completely, then estimate its value and list the disassembled parts on eBay. Because of this, it has been handy to start knowing the going rates of common hardware in the repair industry via primarily eBay. Estimating an iPhone 8 motherboard ICloud Locked? Macbook Top Case & Keyboard Grade B+? I can help ya! In addition, through the course of the business, we also come across a lot of random and old devices, which makes this part of the job a lot more thrilling - feels like a treasure hunt digging into a device I've never seen to uncover its inner hardware!
