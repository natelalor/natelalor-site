        <h4 class="gray_h4">my SFML & M1 Mac C++ linking experience</h4>
        <p>
            My issue was that while I downloaded SFML successfully, the SFML linker support was for x86_64 (or something like that) instead of arm64. In other words, it supported the Intel chip for mac, but not M1 chip for mac. There were a TON of resources for Mac and SFML, and even Mac, SFML, and CLion (<a href="https://remy-villulles.medium.com/compile-and-install-sfml-2-5-1-on-macos-with-clion-and-cmake-b4e52199db1c"target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://giovanni.codes/sfml-2-5-1-setup-on-macos-with-clion/"target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, etc). But the problem was finding one which was arm64 compatible, or M1 compatible.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I had to figure out how to update the SFML compatibility to M1 chip. Fortunately, there was mention of how to do this. This wasn’t a new thing, SFML + M1 (here, here, here, here, and here), but most of the support was for other IDEs (Visual Studio, Xcode, etc). 
        </p>
        <h3>Some support articles almost got me there:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>SFML and Linux (which performed linking similarly, but I couldn’t figure out how to do the directory pathing it wanted me to do): here </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>While other support articles did not: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>terrible website that claimed to have the issue solved: here</li>
            <li>my exact issue on stackoverflow, left unsolved: here</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Finally, I found a video that did work:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>here</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            He shows you how to use Homebrew to install SFML, then finds that installation to point your compiler to it when you try to compile/run your C++ program.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem with this is, obviously, this is a complete workaround to CLion and thus you'd just externally use the command line to compile/run your program. In my case it is doable, but definitely more annoying.
